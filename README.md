### User Stories / MVP

As a listener, I want to...
* Log in and log out in order to view and update my account.
  * Authentication system
  * Login page
* See a ‘newsfeed’ of my connections’ activity in order to easily get recommendations from friends.
  * Newsfeed includes: Likes and Subscribes by friends we "Listen" to
* “Like” episodes or podcasts in order for others to see my recommendations.
* Connect with other podcast listeners in order to tell others about great content and learn about great content from others.
  * User record includes references to other user accounts
* Stream podcasts from my subscriptions in order to enjoy content.
  * HTML streaming features embedded in page
* Subscribe to podcasts in order to have quick access to favorites.
* Search and browse by title to podcasts (and episodes) in a single app in order to find new and interesting podcasts to listen to.

### Future Features:
1. Newsfeed will include new episodes of podcasts I subscribe to.
2. Login will be embedded on website's homepage instead of a separate page.
3. Podcasters can advertise live shows, etc. in their subscribers' newsfeed; settings to allow users to opt in/out of such notices.
